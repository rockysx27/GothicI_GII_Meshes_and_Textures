Copyright Agreement License
1. Ownership of Original Assets
All original models, assets, and resources (collectively referred to as the "Original Assets") used in the project are the exclusive property of THQ Nordic. THQ Nordic retains all rights, titles, and interests in and to the Original Assets.

2. Ownership and Attribution of Modifications
Any modifications, enhancements, or additional work performed by forestk1ne to integrate or polish the Original Assets, including making Gothic 2 compatible with Gothic 1 assets (collectively referred to as the "Modifications"), are the intellectual property of forestk1ne. The name "forestk1ne" must be attached to all such Modifications and may not be removed, altered, or obscured in any distribution, reproduction, or derivative works.

3. Use of Modifications
The Modifications created by forestk1ne may be used under the following conditions:

The Modifications may be used in conjunction with the Original Assets owned by THQ Nordic, provided that proper attribution is given to forestk1ne.
Any project, publication, or product that incorporates the Modifications must credit forestk1ne as a contributor. This credit must be clearly visible and appropriately placed.
For larger projects, including but not limited to commercial products or significant open-source projects, forestk1ne must be prominently mentioned in the credits or acknowledgment sections.
4. Restrictions
The Modifications may not be used, distributed, or otherwise incorporated into other works without proper attribution to forestk1ne.
The name "forestk1ne" may not be removed, altered, or obscured from any of the Modifications, including but not limited to code comments, documentation, or metadata.
The Modifications may not be sublicensed, sold, or otherwise transferred without the express written consent of forestk1ne.
5. Rights Reserved by THQ Nordic
This agreement does not transfer any ownership rights of the Original Assets to forestk1ne. All rights to the Original Assets remain with THQ Nordic, and any use of the Original Assets must comply with THQ Nordic's licensing terms.

6. Update Frequency and License Validity
The Modifications and any associated resources must be updated regularly to ensure compatibility and functionality. If forestk1ne determines that the Modifications are not being updated frequently enough and an outdated version is accessible to users of the package, this may void the license. In such a case, forestk1ne reserves the right to revoke the license and all associated rights to use, distribute, or modify the Modifications.

7. Termination
This license agreement may be terminated if any of the terms herein are violated. Upon termination, all rights to use, distribute, or modify the Modifications revert to forestk1ne, and any further use without consent is prohibited.

8. Governing Law
This agreement is governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction]. Any disputes arising from this agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the applicable legal procedures in [Your Jurisdiction].

9. Entire Agreement
